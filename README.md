Investment calculator

Hi,

This calculator is made to allow user to enter some information, then the calculator
will compute the daily amount of money the user should expect.

The cycle of the investment is 30 working days.

I made this free application for a small company http://freedom-dynamics.fr/

Should you have any question, thanks for contacting me at Jerry-Lawrence@live.fr.

Regards;

Jerry-Lawrence TSIBA
